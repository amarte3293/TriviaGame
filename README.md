# TriviaGame
Game was created with parallex scrolling. 

When the game starts, each question that appears on the screen is timed at 30 seconds, and questions must be answered within that duration. Scores are tallied accordingly as the user has answered.
At the end of the game, the score is revealed to the player and the game is reset.

I had a hard time figuring out how to code this. I did ask for help from a friend. I am planning on redoing this assignment a few times in order to learn how to code this on my own. My friend showed me how to use Google MaterializeCss to do this project. I will attempt to redo this assignment through Bootstrap instead.
